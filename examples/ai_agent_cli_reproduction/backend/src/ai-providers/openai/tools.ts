      Ask the user clarifying questions before implementing anything.

      Use this tool when you have doubts or need more information about:
      - The user's prompt or requirements
      - Ambiguities in the codebase
      - Multiple valid approaches and you need the user to decide
      - Missing context that would affect how the task is implemented

      IMPORTANT: Always use this tool BEFORE starting any implementation if there
      are unresolved questions. Never assume — ask first.

      Input:
      - questions: An array of specific questions to present to the user.

      Returns: void (the user's response will come in the next message)

      Execute a bash command in the project's WSL environment.

      Use this tool when you need to:
      - Inspect the project structure (ls, find, tree)
      - Read files (cat, head, tail)
      - Search code (grep, rg)
      - Check the current directory (pwd)

      Input:
      - command: The bash command to execute.

      Returns:
      {
        stdout: "Command standard output",
        stderr: "Command error output"
      }

      If the command fails unexpectedly, the tool may return null.

      Share the implementation plan with the user before making any changes.

      Use this tool BEFORE implementing any changes or creating any files to
      let the user know exactly what steps you are going to take. This gives
      the user a chance to review and correct the approach before execution.

      Save a durable fact about this project or the user's preferences so it

      Use this tool when you learn something worth remembering long-term:
      - A project convention (e.g. "use pnpm, not npm")
      - A decision the user made that should stick
      - A correction the user gave you that you shouldn't repeat

      Do NOT use this for task-specific details that only matter for the
      current step — only for facts that should apply going forward.

      - fact: One or more standalone facts to remember.
