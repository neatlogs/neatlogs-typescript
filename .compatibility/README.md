# Compatibility automation

This directory defines the integrations, package-manager matrix, supported
versions, and cross-integration contracts exercised by the compatibility
workflows.

## Scope source of truth

The inventory is limited to integrations documented for the TypeScript SDK in
`neatlogs-docs`. The opencode entry is included because it is a documented
coding-agent integration implemented by this package. Claude Code and Codex
are intentionally excluded because they are maintained in separate
repositories. Unsupported/rejection-only stubs are not release-watch targets.

These workflows analyze real published package contents, exported APIs,
dependency graphs, changed source excerpts, the relevant adapter source, and
the official project documentation URLs declared for every integration.
Documentation fetch failures are retained as evidence gaps. They never initialize Neatlogs, call a
live model provider, export traces, or query a Neatlogs backend.

## Pull requests

The pull-request workflow is deterministic and does not receive external
service credentials. It builds and packs the SDK, installs that tarball into
isolated npm, pnpm, and Yarn Berry/PnP consumers, and verifies the public AI
SDK instrumentation interface against the supported AI SDK v6 and v7 lines.

## Scheduled release monitoring

Twice a day, the scheduled workflow:

1. compares the analyzed version lock with the npm registry;
2. records dependency, exported API, source-content, adapter-source, and
   official project-documentation evidence;
3. optionally asks Gemini for an advisory impact assessment;
4. updates a GitHub issue and optionally alerts Slack when review is needed.

The Gemini assessment is advisory only. It cannot change a compatibility
verdict or make a workflow pass.

Configure these GitHub Actions settings:

- Secret `COMPAT_GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional): a dedicated, quota-limited Gemini
  API key. Without it, deterministic discovery/evidence still runs and the LLM
  step records that it was skipped.
- Variable `COMPAT_GEMINI_MODEL` (optional): model override; defaults to
  `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- Secret `COMPAT_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional): a channel-specific Slack
  Incoming Webhook. Without it, Slack notification is skipped.

Organization-level secrets scoped only to the SDK repositories are preferred.
The credentials are used only by the scheduled/default-branch workflow and are
never passed to pull-request jobs. Slack failures are non-blocking; alerts are
sent only for newly discovered releases or workflow failures.
